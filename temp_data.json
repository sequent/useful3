Rate it, and you're done!Simply print this on both sides and hole punch it with a ARC punch to easily go into your Happy Planner. You can even use this on your Erin Condren planner as well by attaching it with coil clips.I find it fun to have a separate tab at the end of my Happy Planner for my Book Journal.WHAT'S INCLUDED WITH THIS PURCHASE:- Ready to print two page PDF!WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO HAVE:- A computer :)- A printer (color printer if you want to print as pictured)- A hole punch for your planner (or individual hole punch)- 8-1/2\" x 11\" paper PRINTING TIPS:- For optimum print quality, have your printer set on the highest quality. - Make sure you select print setting \"Actual size\" so it doesn't resize the document.- It is preferable to use 28# or 32# 8-1/2 x 11 paper. This thickness will give best results and less bleed through as you write in them.CUTTING TIPS:The corner crop marks in this file are sized to fit a Happy Planner specifically. I recommend cutting the bottom of the sheet first, then moving on to the sides, and last the top.* You understand this is a digital download product and you won't receive a physical product for this purchase.* You cannot sell or share this file after you purchase it, it is intended for your personal use only.HELP!

This thickness will give best results and less bleed through as you write in them.CUTTING TIPS:The corner crop marks in this file are sized to fit a Happy Planner specifically. I recommend cutting the bottom of the sheet first, then moving on to the sides, and last the top.* You understand this is a digital download product and you won't receive a physical product for this purchase.* You cannot sell or share this file after you purchase it, it is intended for your personal use only.HELP!

My shop is designed to provide encouragement, comfort, recognition and love to those who struggle with any type of mental health issue. PLEASE NOTE: Many mental health illnesses can involve intense/distressing memories and feelings. Journaling may not be suitable for everyone. It is always wise to check with your doctor or therapist before journaling. Each journal contains different types of pages, none of which are providing medical advice. The different types of pages are:- Tracking/Logging: These pages are set up as blank charts/tables/spreadsheets for the purpose of tracking certain behaviors, thoughts & emotions, and recording potential growth.- Lists: These pages contain comprehensive lists (example: emotions, thoughts, activities) and can be used as a reference sheet. - Guided Journaling: These pages contain questions/prompts for those who benefit from daily writing.   - Encouragement: These sheets are designed to encourage, such as \u201c15 ways to love your body,\u201d and are not meant to be received as medical advice. The reason I created Therapy Journals is because I have spent many years in therapy for Depression, and I have been through intensive residential treatment for Bulimia, and I have developed a strong passion for those who suffer from a mental health illness. Journaling has been a very helpful tool for me, and I want to share that resource with others. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Thank you for shopping with me!

My shop is designed to provide encouragement, comfort, recognition and love to those who struggle with any type of mental health issue. PLEASE NOTE: Many mental health illnesses can involve intense/distressing memories and feelings. Journaling may not be suitable for everyone. It is always wise to check with your doctor or therapist before journaling. Each journal contains different types of pages, none of which are providing medical advice. The different types of pages are:- Tracking/Logging: These pages are set up as blank charts/tables/spreadsheets for the purpose of tracking certain behaviors, thoughts & emotions, and recording potential growth.- Lists: These pages contain comprehensive lists (example: emotions, thoughts, activities) and can be used as a reference sheet. - Guided Journaling: These pages contain questions/prompts for those who benefit from daily writing.   - Encouragement: These sheets are designed to encourage, such as \u201c15 ways to love your body,\u201d and are not meant to be received as medical advice. The reason I created Therapy Journals is because I have spent many years in therapy for Depression, and I have been through intensive residential treatment for Bulimia, and I have developed a strong passion for those who suffer from a mental health illness. Journaling has been a very helpful tool for me, and I want to share that resource with others. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Thank you for shopping with me!

This thickness will give best results and less bleed through as you write in them.CUTTING TIPS:The corner crop marks in this file are sized to fit a Happy Planner specifically.

My shop is designed to provide encouragement, comfort, recognition and love to those who struggle with any type of mental health issue. PLEASE NOTE: Many mental health illnesses can involve intense/distressing memories and feelings. Journaling may not be suitable for everyone. It is always wise to check with your doctor or therapist before journaling. Each journal contains different types of pages, none of which are providing medical advice. The different types of pages are:- Tracking/Logging: These pages are set up as blank charts/tables/spreadsheets for the purpose of tracking certain behaviors, thoughts & emotions, and recording potential growth.- Lists: These pages contain comprehensive lists (example: emotions, thoughts, activities) and can be used as a reference sheet. - Guided Journaling: These pages contain questions/prompts for those who benefit from daily writing.   - Encouragement: These sheets are designed to encourage, such as \u201c15 ways to love your body,\u201d and are not meant to be received as medical advice. The reason I created Therapy Journals is because I have spent many years in therapy for Depression, and I have been through intensive residential treatment for Bulimia, and I have developed a strong passion for those who suffer from a mental health illness. Journaling has been a very helpful tool for me, and I want to share that resource with others. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Thank you for shopping with me!
