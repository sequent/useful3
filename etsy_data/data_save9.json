When purchasing this listing, please select from the Purchase Options dropdown menu to either select the Hard Copy Sample set or Customized Deposit.  \u2665 If you select the HARD COPY SAMPLE OPTION, you are purchasing a set of hard copy generic samples of a Passport Invitation Suite printed on each of the different paper choices, along with all of the different envelope choices so you can see and feel the different options in person before you customize your very own invitation set.        \u2022 Once you purchase the Hard Copy Sample option, your samples will be mailed to you in 1-2 business days via first class USPS mail and you should receive them in 3-6 business days from the date they are mailed. \u2665 If you select the CUSTOMIZED DEPOSIT OPTION, you are purchasing a deposit towards your full customized Passport Invitation order to get the design process started.  Customization of the text and colors of this design are included in your Customized Deposit purchase. ****************************************************\u2665 INSTRUCTIONS FOR CUSTOMIZED DEPOSIT OPTION:Please scroll through all of the photos in the listing to find the options and pricing is on the last photo. To start your order, purchase the Customized Deposit option from the dropdown menu and then send this shop a message with the answers to the following 13 questions (please copy and paste into your reply and add your responses). 1. Have you read the HOW IT WORKS and TURNAROUND TIMES section below? Please review and confirm your understanding of our process and timeline. 2. What is the exact wording you would like on your invitation card? IMPORTANT: please define which wording goes on each page and PLEASE DO NOT TYPE IN ALL CAPS- You may pick to have just the 2 pages printed on the inside of the passport cover (traditional invitation wording page and the passport photo page) or you can purchase an insert a sheet which gives you 4 extra pages (plus the 2 pages that are printed on the back side of the cover to equal total 6 pages inside the passport) to include things like information about the accommodations, itinerary, other events and the location). - IMPORTANT: Please be sure to triple check your wording for spelling and accuracy before you send it to me as revisions after I create your initial proofs will cause delays.  - You may use the example text here, if needed: https://www.dropbox.com/s/elf3a4vv4iy2cky/Passport%20Sample%20Wording%20Lucky%20Lady%20Paper%20Green%20Leafy.pdf?dl=03. Exact wording you would like on your RSVP card (if purchasing RSVP cards) and whether you prefer the a) Card with envelope (either traditional or boarding pass style) or b) Postcard style.  If purchasing the postcard style, please include the return address you would like printed on the card.4. If ordering RSVP cards with envelopes, would you like your return address printed on the front of the envelopes ($0.75 each envelope)? 5. What is the exact # of sets you would like printed? TIP: order 5-10 extra in case you need to invite more people/need to resend invites because some you sent got lost in the mail and for your own keepsakes because if you need to order a few extra later, the price per invite for orders less than 25 is higher).    6. Would you like REAL gold foil (shiny/metallic) finishing on the front cover? If you do not select this option, I will apply a faux foil effect on the graphics and text so that it has the appearance of real foil but won't actually be shiny/metallic. If you would like real foil, the only paper choice available is Luxe Petal.  Foil colors available are rose gold, regular gold and silver. 7. What is your printing paper choice? Note: see below for paper choice descriptions. If you are unsure after reading the descriptions, please purchase the Hard Copy Sample purchase option first so that you can see and feel the different options in person first.a) Luxe Petal with REAL gold foil on the front cover of the passport (only option available if you answered \"yes\" to question 6)b) Stardream Shimmer c) Faux Leatherd) Plain Jane 8. What is your free matching Envelope Choice (White or Kraft Paper)? White shimmer envelopes are available for an extra $0.11 per envelope.

To order samples of all of the different paper choices first, please select the Hard Copy Sample purchase option. Our wedding invitations are flat printed on the highest quality heavy card stock using a commercial press, resulting in the most beautiful, professional quality wedding invitations.  We use only the absolute best in printing and paper, giving our stationery a level of quality that is unmatched.You have the following options for your Passport Cover: \u2022 LUXE PETAL is a heavy card stock with a luxurious, rose petal soft matte coating on the outside and a smooth uncoated finish on the inside. Our most realistic choice when compared to a real passport! \u2022 STARDREAM SHIMMER is a pearlescent, slightly shimmery heavy card stock. Since it is opalescent and actually sparkles, it reminds me of how the sand and ocean sparkle in the sun!\u2022 FAUX LEATHER is an embossed heavy card stock with a leather-like texture on the outside and a smooth uncoated finish on the inside.\u2022 PLAIN JANE is a smooth (untextured) heavy card stock without coating. ****************************************************\u2665 PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING BEFORE PURCHASING THIS LISTING\u2022 All prices listed in these item details are in USD. \u2022 The fonts shown in the design for this listing are part of the design.  Requests to change the font will be considered for a $25 extra design fee if approved.\u2022 Hard Copy Samples can not be customized to your wording and/or colors. If you would like to receive a hard copy sample of your customized design, you may elect to receive your hard copy sample(s) prior to your full order being printed, after purchasing your customized invitation set. \u2022 Sales tax will be applied as required by law (based on purchaser's state law)\u2022 Insert sheets do not come assembled and come unbound to the cover. They also do not come with materials (such as ribbon/string) to bind them.
